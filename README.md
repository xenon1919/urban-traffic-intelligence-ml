# Urban Traffic Intelligence ML

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts travel time, classifies traffic congestion levels, and discovers traffic patterns using supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Objectives
- Travel time prediction (Regression)
- Traffic congestion classification (Classification)
- Traffic pattern discovery (Clustering)

## Models Used
- Linear & Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- KNN
- SVM
- XGBoost
- KMeans

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn



## Outcome
Built, evaluated, and justified multiple ML models while demonstrating bias–variance tradeoff and proper model evaluation.
